                <div class="speaker-bio">
                    <p>Amit is a retired professor of physics from the University of Oregon, where he served on the
                        faculty
                        from 1968 to 1997. The meaning of quantum physics was highly obscured. While
                        researching this, Amit discovered that when quantum physics is formulated within the metaphysics
                        of qualified non-dualism, as in Indian Vedanta, questions regarding meaning are immediately
                        resolved. His work thus integrates science and spirituality. This work has culminated in his
                        most recent book with the physician Valentina Onisor, Quantum Spirituality.<span
                            class="hide-9">Subsequently, he
                            developed a theory of reincarnation and integrated conventional and alternative medicine
                            within
                            the new quantum science of health. Among his discoveries are the quantum theory of the
                            creative
                            process, the theory of quantum evolution, and the theory of quantum economics that extends
                            Adam’s Smith’s capitalism into a workable paradigm for the 21st century.
                            In 2009, he started a movement called “quantum activism,” now gaining ground in North and
                            South
                            America, Southern and Eastern Europe, and India. In 2018, together with his collaborators,
                            he
                            established Quantum Activism Vishwalayam, an institution of transformative education in
                            India,
                            based on quantum science and the primacy of consciousness. This program offers master’s and
                            PhD
                            programs in the Quantum Science of Health, Prosperity and Happiness under the auspices of
                            University of Technology, Jaipur.
                            Amit is the author of numerous books, most notably: The Self-Aware Universe, Physics of the
                            Soul, The Quantum Doctor, God is Not Dead, Quantum Creativity, and The Everything Answer
                            Book.
                            He was featured in the movie What the Bleep Do We Know!? and the documentaries Dalai Lama
                            Renaissance and The Quantum Activist.
                            Amit is a spiritual practitioner and calls himself a quantum activist in search of
                            Wholeness.
