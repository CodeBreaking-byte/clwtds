                <p>Dr. Singh was an outstanding person and a good friend. And I appreciated very much his visit for my
                    90th birthday celebration. 
                        Dr. Singh’s contributions to the understanding of religion and the
                        relation between science and religion and have been important and will have a long-standing
                        influence. – Prof. Charles H. Townes

                <p>Dr. T. D. Singh represents for me a perfect role model how citizens and in particular academics
                    should think, feel and behave: He has been building bridges between groups of society and between
                    different schools of thought. He has bridged the gaps between science and philosophy. He showed to
                    us what wisdom and compassion really mean. Let us keep his spirit alive, let’s not forget him as a
                    role model and improve our own being! – Richard R. Ernst</p>

                <p>In the last decade of His life, I had the lucky occasion to meet the spiritual leader Dr. T. D. Singh
                    at three occasions in my office at the University of Basel. In very lively and friendly discussions
                    we touched scientific and
                    spiritual questions related to the genetics and the evolution of living
                    organisms. <span class="hide-4"> These debates benefited from a deep, mutual understanding, in which the importance of
                    devoting particular attention to the interface between scientific knowledge and spirituality was
                    highlighted. While Dr. Singh particularly appreciated my scientifically based views on the
                    process
                    of biological evolution, I enjoyed his spiritual views based on traditional wisdom as well as
                    his
                    open-minded readiness to co-integrate on common grounds our knowledge and beliefs in order to
                    improve our humble understanding of the great complexity of life. – Werner Arber.
                    <br> I remember with fondness the stimulating conversation we had during Dr. T. D. Singh visit
                    to
                    Gaithersburg on June 10, 2005. I thank God for Dr. Singh’s work on the relationship of
                    scientific
                    and religious thinking, and pray that his efforts will continue to be fruitful in bringing
                    greater
                    peace and harmony to all. – William D. Phillips</span>
